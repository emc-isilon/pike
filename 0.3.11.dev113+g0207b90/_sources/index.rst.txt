************
What is pike
************

``pike`` is an `SMB2 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/5606ad47-5ee0-437a-817e-70c366052962>`_
client implemented in Python, with a focus on *testability* and *extensibility*.

It is not **NOT** fast.

********
Why pike
********

``pike`` provides access to windows, macOS, or samba (linux) shares
in a platform-independent way.

``pike`` can be used to reproduce strange protocol interactions and
develop regression tests. It provides deep access to view and manipulate
protocol internals.

``pike`` is asynchronous, allowing many operations to be in flight at once.

***********
Quick Start
***********

Connect to a share and write to a file
======================================

.. code-block:: python

   from pike import TreeConnect

   with TreeConnect(server="127.0.0.1", creds="myuser%S3cUrePassw0rd", share="stuff") as tc:
      subdir = tc / "fun_and_games"
      subdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
      (subdir / "pike1.txt").write_text("Pike makes SMB2 look easy")


Passing ``TreeConnect`` Environment Variables
=============================================

Hard coding addresses and credentials is fine at the REPL, but a script
should prefer to not specify these values and fall back to the default
environment variables:

    - ``PIKE_SERVER``
    - ``PIKE_PORT``
    - ``PIKE_CREDS`` (percent delimited)
    - ``PIKE_SHARE``

Refer to :py:class:`pike.test.Options` for a complete list of variables.

Subsequent examples will not pass arguments explicitly.

Using the ``Pathlike`` interface
================================

the :py:class:`~pike.TreeConnect` object can be used with the division operator
to construct a ``Pathlike`` object, :py:class:`~pike.path.PikePath`. The
returned instance is bound to the particular tree connect and session and can
perform most common `Path <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods>`_
operations.

.. code-block:: python

   from pike import TreeConnect
   from pike.smb2 import FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION

   with TreeConnect() as tc:
      for item in (tc / ".").glob("*.txt"):
         eof = item.stat(file_information_class=FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION).end_of_file
         print("{} EOF is {}".format(item, eof)

      smb_file = (tc / "filelike.txt")
      with smb_file.open("w+") as fh:
         fh.write("Treat is like a local file\n")
         fh.seek(0)
         print(fh.read())
      smb_file.unlink()

Pytest Integration
==================

A `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_ fixture,
:py:func:`~pike.pytest_support.pike_TreeConnect` provides access to the
:py:class:`~pike.TreeConnect` object with dialect and capability requirement
marks applied.

Additionally, the :py:func:`~pike.pytest_support.pike_tmp_path` fixture
provides a ``Pathlike`` object pointing to the default SMB server / share,
similar to pytest's built in `tmp_path
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/tmpdir.html#the-tmp-path-fixture>`_ fixture

SMB2 Mapped Operations
======================

:py:mod:`pike.model` provides access to the SMB2 protocol operations.

Of particular interest is :py:func:`pike.model.Channel.create` which is used to
open a file, returning a :py:class:`~pike.model.Future` for a
:py:class:`pike.io.Open` which provides the file-like API as well as convenience
wrappers into all other :py:class:`pike.model.Channel` calls that take an
:py:class:`~pike.io.Open` as a parameter.
